    "## Simple CNN for Edgelovers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you train a very simple CNN with only 1 kernel to discriminate images containing vertical (y=0) from those containing horizontal stripes (y=1). \n",

    "\n",
    "### a)  Generation of the data\n",
    "Write a function which creates an artficially dataset of greyscale images (50x50 pixel) with 10 vertical or horizontal bars (10 pixel long). Use this function to create a training and validation dataset of 1000 examples each.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) Build the simplest possible CNN\n",
    "Make a CNN with one convolution, haveing two outputs (one for horizontal, one for vertical). Train the CNN on the data from a). \n",
    "* Plot the learning curves: (epochs vs training loss and validation loss) and epochs vs accuracy.You should get an accuracy of approximatly 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c) Visualize the learned kernel\n",
    "Visualize the learned kernel, you might want to use `model.get_weights()`. Does the learned kernel makes sense?"
